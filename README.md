*Let's collect ideas with `Digging` !*

- When we digging up ideas
- When we gather information
- When we save ideas
- When we check the information
- When we look for ideas

Digging is a service that allows you to easily save ideas and find them again. I named it 'Digging' based on the image of MZ generation digging music, video, etc. In fact, we made Brand experience with the meaning of dig. Logo, color, font, etc. were modified to be used in many situations.
We've improved the paint points we've felt in existing services so that you can easily save them on the go, select and create your own tags, and find them quickly. Due to the nature of the job, I hope it will be a helpful app for those who see many articles and record their ideas.
